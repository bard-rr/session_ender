- pseudocode:
  - iterate over sessions that have started but not yet ended (i.e. the entirety of the intermediary store)
    - query clickhouse for all events for that session that happened with the last X minutes
    - if there are no such events, then end the session
      - select the most recent event for the session
      - update the session's end time to be the timestamp of that event
      - calculate any other outstanding session data (e.g. length)
      - move the session data from the intermediary store to clickhouse atomically
        - what if a session with the same id already exists in clickhouse? the code that starts a session will protect against this

- issues:
  - re: "the last X minutes":
    - this has to be related to the MAX_IDLE_TIME set on the agent
    - specifically, it should be greater than that MAX_IDLE_TIME... but by how much... maybe for now just add 1 minute
  - how often should this script run?
    - continuously?
    - at some interval of time related to MAX_IDLE_TIME?
    - what's the objective? are sessions hidden from the user until they are complete? if so then the frequency with which we check to close sessions determines how soon sessions are made visible to the user... if not then it just determines how soon session metadata (e.g. end time, length) becomes correctly populated...
    - maybe just do it continuously for now and revisit later

- plan of attack
  - implement querying from clickhouse
