- pseudocode:
  - iterate over sessions that have started but not yet ended (i.e. the entirety of the intermediary store)
    - if last event timestamp is not withing the last X minutes, then end the session
      - update the session's end time to be the timestamp of the last event
      - calculate any other outstanding session data (e.g. length)
      - move the session data from the intermediary store to clickhouse atomically
        - what if a session with the same id already exists in clickhouse? the code that starts a session will protect against this

- issues:
  - re: "the last X minutes":
    - this has to be related to the MAX_IDLE_TIME set on the agent
    - specifically, it should be greater than that MAX_IDLE_TIME... but by how much... maybe for now just add 1 minute
  - how often should this script run?
    - continuously?
    - at some interval of time related to MAX_IDLE_TIME?
    - what's the objective? are sessions hidden from the user until they are complete? if so then the frequency with which we check to close sessions determines how soon sessions are made visible to the user... if not then it just determines how soon session metadata (e.g. end time, length) becomes correctly populated...
    - maybe just do it continuously for now and revisit later

- plan of attack
  - implement querying from clickhouse
  - set up postgres and put some mock data in it
    - make a script that sets up the db
